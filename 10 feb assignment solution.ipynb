    "\n",
    "Read mode ('r'): This is the default mode. It is used to open a file for reading. If the file does not exist, it will result in a FileNotFoundError. When a file is opened in read mode, it is not possible to modify the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write mode ('w'): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated (i.e., deleted) before the new data is written to the file. When a file is opened in write mode, it is not possible to read the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append mode ('a'): This mode is used to open a file for appending new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. When a file is opened in append mode, the cursor is positioned at the end of the file, so any new data is written at the end of the existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary mode ('b'): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. It is used for files that contain non-text data, such as images, audio files, or binary data. When a file is opened in binary mode, the data is read or written as bytes instead of as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text mode ('t'): This mode is used to open a file in text mode. It is used for files that contain text data, such as CSV files or text documents. When a file is opened in text mode, the data is read or written as Unicode characters.\n",

    "1. It releases any system resources that were being used by the file object. When we open a file, the operating system allocates system resources such as file descriptors to that file. If we don't close the file, those resources remain allocated, which can lead to resource leaks or other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It flushes any data that is still in the buffer to the file. When we write to a file, the data is often first stored in a buffer rather than being immediately written to the file on disk. This is done for performance reasons, since writing to disk can be slow. However, if we don't flush the buffer or close the file, the data in the buffer may not be written to the file, which can result in data loss.\n",
